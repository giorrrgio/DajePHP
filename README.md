Daje PHP
========

Daje is a PHP Framework for REST API services.

### Features

1. Respects the [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/).
2. REST by default.
3. No Config at all by default.
4. Democratic, developer-oriented.
5. High quality.
6. Uses [Stack Middlewares](http://stackphp.com/middlewares/) for not reinventing the HTTP wheel
7. Uses [Dice](https://r.je/dice.html) as a Dependency Injection Container.
DajePHP is designed for making your life easier if you BDD or DDD, but it won't force you to use any methodology.
